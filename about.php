      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>RAMP is a collaborative effort that has brought together curators, programmers, and cataloging and metadata librarians at the <a href="http://library.miami.edu/" target="_blank">University of Miami Libraries</a> in Coral Gables, Florida. RAMP is open source software available under an <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/ECL-2.0" target="_blank">Educational Community License, Version 2.0</a> (ECL-2.0) and can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/UMiamiLibraries/RAMP" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <p>The data currently being pulled into RAMP comes from three sources: finding aids for archival collections (supplied locally), the <a href="http://viaf.org" target="_blank">Virtual International Authority File</a> (VIAF), and <a href="http://worldcat.org/identities/" target="_blank">WorldCat Identities</a>. Data from the latter two sources is available under an <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/" target="_blank">ODC (Open Data Commons) Attribution license</a>. To be contributed to Wikipedia, locally produced finding aid texts would need to be released, per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Donating_copyrighted_materials#Granting_us_permission_to_copy_material_already_online" target="_blank">Wikipedia guidelines</a>, under CC-BY-SA and GDL licenses. The current <a href="http://demo.rampeditor.info" target="_blank">RAMP demo site</a> has been loaded with a set of <a href="http://findingaids.loc.gov/" target="_blank">Library of Congress finding aids</a>, which, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Public_domain_resources#U.S._federal_government" target="_blank">texts produced by U.S. government employees</a> in fulfillment of their duties, are in the public domain.</p>
